1) Create a root folder to run MILS
2) Generate a 'simulation_constants.mat' file through the 'simulation_constants.m' script file in the Simulation Constants Folder
	While running MILS, you can change the parameters in the .m file and run to generate .mat 
3) Copy the 'simulation_constants.mat' file into the new root simulation folder which you created earlier to run simulation
4) Run the 'STADS_MILS.mlx' script with the address of the root simulation folder 

Note: Current directory while running any code on matlab should be the root directory of STADS, also the 
project file should be loaded
