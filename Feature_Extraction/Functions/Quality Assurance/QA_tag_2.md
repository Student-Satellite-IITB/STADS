### Iteration - 1

**Code Author:** Millen Kanabar


**Review requested by:** Millen Kanabar


**Reviewer:** Aravind Bharathi

2. https://github.com/TheWeepingSage/STADS/blob/master/Feature_Extraction/Functions/README_tag_2.pdf

**QA suggestions:**

1. Include an explanation for the columns of arr_sums

2. Change the name of the iterator variable to avoid confusion as the word 'tag' appears frequently in the block

3. Eliminate the need to initialise variables in the last few lines and instead switch up the output of the function


**Implementation:**

1. arr_sums(1) is the summation of  intensity times x coordinate
...

2. i_set_tags, j_set_tags

3. function [arr_sums(:, 1), arr_sums(:, 2)...
