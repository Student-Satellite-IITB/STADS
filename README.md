## Note

1. Always run from the root folder - *.\*
    * You can verify this by typing **pwd** in the command window of MATLAB.
    * The **ans** should read - *.....\STADS*

1. Run the command:
    **addpath(genpath('.\'));**
    * This will add directories and sub-directories to MATLAB's search path - *This is a one-time command, to be performed before you run any code!*
    * Any function/script can now be called easily across the whole repository
